Neural Networks and Learning Machines
===============

Rusty solutions to selected problems in [1], e.g. half moon dataset:
* prog1_6: Pereptron 
* prog2_8: Least Squares
* prog5_11: Radial Basis Function network; kmeans + LMS/RHS training of weights

See src/bin - e.g. problem 5.11, train a Radial Basis Function network on the halfmoon classification task: 

```
% cargo run --bin prog5_11
```
